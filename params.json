Explain a bit more, citing previous literature.\r\n\r\nOur project applies machine learning techniques to mitigate this risk by creating a predictive model for loan defaults.\r\nSpecifically, we are looking at predicting defaults among two populations:\r\n\r\n* Lending Club’s current loans\r\n* New Lending Club customers\r\n\r\n# Methods.\r\n##Data exploration\r\nWe used data from [Lending Club](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data), on loans issued by the platform from 2007-2015. There were **887379 loans** in the dataset, and **74 predictor variables**. \r\n\r\nInsert visualizations of trends in the data - milestones 1-3?\r\n\r\n##Data pre-processing\r\nWe then proceeded to clean the data in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. Removed loans whose \"loan status\" was \"Current\". This left us with approximately **250,000 loans** in the dataset.\r\n2. Recoded \"loan status\" to a variable called \"default\", with loans being assigned a value of \"0\" (if they had/were not in default), and \"1\" (if they had defaulted). Defaulted loans constituted about **16.6%** of all loans. \r\n3. Removed all predictor variables which contained >70% missing values.\r\n4. Imputed all remaining missing values with the median value of their respective predictor variable column. This approach was relatively unproblematic, as we had a high number of remaining observations in our dataset (250,000). \r\n\r\n## Model fitting\r\nWe then split the data into training and testing datasets (60-40), and fit the following 5 models on the training dataset:\r\n\r\n* Logistic regression\r\n* Linear Discriminant Analysis\r\n* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis\r\n* Decision Trees\r\n* Random Forests\r\n\r\n## Cross-validation\r\nThereafter, we performed 5-fold cross-validation on the 3 models which most accurately predicted loan defaults in the testing dataset:\r\n\r\n* Logistic regression (**C regularization parameter**)\r\n* Decision Trees (**depth of tree**, **minimum number of samples per leaf**)\r\n* Random Forests (**number of trees**)\r\n\r\n# Prediction.\r\n##Model predictive accuracy\r\nOur optimal model after cross validation, judged by predictive accuracy on class 1, was **regularized logistic regression**.\r\n\r\n![Image of Predictive Accuracy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darlian/cs109a_loan/gh-pages/predictive%20accuracy%20-%20table.png)\r\n\r\nWe tuned the value of the regularization parameter of the logistic regression model, to maximize predictive accuracy on class 1. A **value of 10^-3** generated the best score.\r\n\r\n![Image of CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darlian/cs109a_loan/gh-pages/CV_logreg.png)\r\n\r\n##Feature importance\r\nInsert decision tree.\r\n\r\nLast Payment Amount\r\n1.1 : Outstanding Loan Principal (Investors)\r\nSplit 1.1.1: Total Principal Received \r\nSplit 1.1.2: Total Payment Received (Investors)\r\n1.2: Total Late Fees Received\r\nSplit 1.2.1: Installments\r\nSplit 1.2.2: Total Principal Received \r\n\r\nVariables related to a borrower’s past payment behaviour were the most predictive of a current borrower’s eventual default, which makes intuitive sense. However, for new borrowers, other variables like FICO score would be salient.\r\n\r\n##Model removing features related to payments on ongoing loans\r\nInsert info.\r\n\r\n##Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n",
