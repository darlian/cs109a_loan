<p>Peer-2-peer financial institutions like <strong>Lending Club</strong> are exposed to risk from loan default. Explain a bit more, citing previous literature.</p>

<p>Our project applies machine learning techniques to mitigate this risk by creating a predictive model for loan defaults.
Specifically, we are looking at predicting defaults among two populations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lending Club’s current loans</li>
<li>New Lending Club customers</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="data-exploration" class="anchor" href="#data-exploration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data exploration</h2>

<p>We used data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data">Lending Club</a>, on loans issued by the platform from 2007-2015. There were <strong>887379 loans</strong> in the dataset, and <strong>74 predictor variables</strong>. </p>

<p>Insert visualizations of trends in the data - milestones 1-3?</p>

<h2>
<a id="data-pre-processing" class="anchor" href="#data-pre-processing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data pre-processing</h2>

<p>We then proceeded to clean the data in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Removed loans whose "loan status" was "Current". This left us with approximately <strong>250,000 loans</strong> in the dataset.</li>
<li>Recoded "loan status" to a variable called "default", with loans being assigned a value of "0" (if they had/were not in default), and "1" (if they had defaulted). Defaulted loans constituted about <strong>16.6%</strong> of all loans. </li>
<li>Removed all predictor variables which contained &gt;70% missing values.</li>
<li>Imputed all remaining missing values with the median value of their respective predictor variable column. This approach was relatively unproblematic, as we had a high number of remaining observations in our dataset (250,000). </li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="model-fitting" class="anchor" href="#model-fitting" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Model fitting</h2>

<p>We then split the data into training and testing datasets (60-40), and fit the following 5 models on the training dataset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Logistic regression</li>
<li>Linear Discriminant Analysis</li>
<li>Quadratic Discriminant Analysis</li>
<li>Decision Trees</li>
<li>Random Forests</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="cross-validation" class="anchor" href="#cross-validation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cross-validation</h2>

<p>Thereafter, we performed 5-fold cross-validation on the 3 models which most accurately predicted loan defaults in the testing dataset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Logistic regression (<strong>C regularization parameter</strong>)</li>
<li>Decision Trees (<strong>depth of tree</strong>, <strong>minimum number of samples per leaf</strong>)</li>
<li>Random Forests (<strong>number of trees</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="model-predictive-accuracy" class="anchor" href="#model-predictive-accuracy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Model predictive accuracy</h2>

<p>Our optimal model after cross validation, judged by predictive accuracy on class 1, was <strong>regularized logistic regression</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darlian/cs109a_loan/gh-pages/predictive%20accuracy%20-%20table.png" alt="Image of Predictive Accuracy"></p>

<p>We tuned the value of the regularization parameter of the logistic regression model, to maximize predictive accuracy on class 1. A <strong>value of 10^-3</strong> generated the best score.</p>

<h2>
<a id="feature-importance" class="anchor" href="#feature-importance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Feature importance</h2>

<p>Insert decision tree.</p>

<p>Last Payment Amount
1.1 : Outstanding Loan Principal (Investors)
Split 1.1.1: Total Principal Received 
Split 1.1.2: Total Payment Received (Investors)
1.2: Total Late Fees Received
Split 1.2.1: Installments
Split 1.2.2: Total Principal Received </p>

<p>Variables related to a borrower’s past payment behaviour were the most predictive of a current borrower’s eventual default, which makes intuitive sense. However, for new borrowers, other variables like FICO score would be salient.</p>
